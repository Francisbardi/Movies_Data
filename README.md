## INTRODUCTION 
Movies data is a dataset gotten during my participation in a mini data analysis bootcamp program. This is an SQL project that seeks to analyze and answer questions which will provide insights and eventually help in making data driven decisions for the company.

## Problem statements
1. What are the top 3 ratings for movies released in the United States?
2. What are the Top 10 companies based on number of movies? 
3. What are the Top 10 companies in the United Kingdom based on movie revenue? (released country) 
4. What are the Top 10 companies in the countries that begin with “I” based on the movie revenue? (released country) 
5. What is the average movie time for movies in France and any country that contains Germany (released country)? 
6. As a single analyst, what is the average movie time for movies with title that contain ‘love’? 
7. Which company has generated most revenue? How much did they make in 2018? 
8. Which star has been featured in most movies? What are the top 3 movies genre he/she has acted in? 
9. Which movie genre is most popular in India? What is the average revenue generated for this movie genre in India? (country of origin) 
10. How many movies start with a consonant letter? 

## Skills demonstrated
Among other basic SQl clauses and functions i used the order by  clause, group by clause, and sub-query function.

## Data cleaning and Transformation 
The data was relatively clean and so only minimal transformation was required which was to split **released column** into **released_date** and **released_year** on excel

## Analysis
